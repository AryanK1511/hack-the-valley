**Path4Me** is all about intuitive, real-time navigation for visually impaired users. It's a cap with mounted tech. The user starts by rotating 360 degrees, which allows the system to **calibrate** and build a clear map.

For now, it identifies doors, but this can expand to other objects or destinations. The user wears a headset that delivers **3D spatial sound**, guiding them with directional cues (left, right, forward) in real-time, making navigation seamless and **cane-free**!
